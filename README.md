# Geometric Calculator 🧮📐

This Python project is a **Geometric Shape Area Calculator**.  
It allows users to input dimensions for various 2D shapes and calculates their area.

## 📌 Supported Shapes

- Square
- Rectangle
- Triangle
- Right Triangle
- Circle
- Hexagon

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive command-line interface
- Input validation for positive numeric values
- Object-oriented structure (each shape is a class)
- Modular design: each shape has its own file
- Easily extendable for more shapes

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to choose a shape.
2. It asks for the required dimensions (e.g., base, height, radius).
3. It calculates and prints the area using the appropriate formula.
